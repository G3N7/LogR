Simple JS Console Logging Framework

LogR is built with [TypeScript](typescriptlang.org) and as such there are a options for how to reference it.

* [LogR.ts](https://github.com/G3N7/logR/blob/master/logR.Build/LogR.ts) - if you would like to take and modify/compile the typescript yourself.
* [LogR.js](https://github.com/G3N7/logR/blob/master/logR.Build/logR.js) - if you would like to use the js directly.
